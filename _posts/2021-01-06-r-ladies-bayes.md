I had the opportunity to present at the [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-rtp/) January 2021 meeting, which is the local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/). My talk was a gentle introduction to Bayesian methods and some R packages for fitting Bayesian models. I demonstrated how to fit various regression models in the `rstanarm`, `rethinking` and `brms` packages.  I also described a beginner-friendly path towards working with `rstan` directly.  The content of my talk can be found [here](https://melissa-wong.github.io/r-ladies-bayes-pkgs/).
