I joined [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in March 2021 as a Test & Evaluation Statistician.  Prior to that I was a member of the Senior Professional Staff at [The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.jhuapl.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I've worked on a diverse set of projects including cyber operations, space situational awareness and operational testing. Many of the projects I've worked on are classified, but I do have a few [examples of my work](https://melissa-wong.github.io/projects/) I'm able to share here.

Since completing my M.S. in Statistics from [Texas A&M University](https://stat.tamu.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I have a newfound interest in Bayesian methods, causal inference and decision making under uncertainty. Now that I've completed my degree, I can look back at some of the concepts I really struggled with initially and see how presenting them differently could have helped me understand much more quickly. To that end, I started a [blog](https://melissa-wong.github.io/posts/) where I illustrate those concepts using shiny apps in a way that hopefully others will find helpful.

In my spare time you'll find me horseback riding (I used to compete in eventing), spending time with my family or reading a good book.
